# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Demo App
A simple web app demonstrating how text sounds in different TTS voices.

Convert your text to speech using voices provided by a variety of TTS services, the full list including their limitations can be found further down this readme.

## About
This project originally came about from a desire to emulate how messages will sound when donating to [Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) streamers, many of whom use Streamlabs/StreamElements TTS features to have donations read aloud (often by 'Brian') during their streams. ![FeelsGoodMan](https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/109777/1)

It was inspired by Peter Cunha's [similar tool](https://github.com/petercunha/tts). I wanted to build it using only vanilla JS, as well as improve it with UI/UX enhancements and by providing a massive selection of voices, including **all** those offered by Amazon Polly and other services. The project has grown somewhat bigger than the single file demo it was initially, and is now effectively a full PHP library and demo website.


## Features
- Over 1000 different high-quality voices
- Lightning fast
- Copy link to TTS URL to clipboard for sharing with others
- Save audio locally for a configurable amount of time
- Plain old HTML5 and vanilla JavaScript (PHP >=8 required for full functionality)
- Conversations - create a conversation using multiple TTS voices and share it as a playlist of TTS audio clips.

## Using
The basic requirements are some kind of web server with PHP >= 8.0 installed and a working copy of composer. A Docker compose file is included to handle all this for you.

`docker compose up`

If not using Docker I'll assume you've already got this repo on a server; you'll need to run

`composer install`

in the directory to generate the autoloader classes.

Please check the generated `config.php` file and adjust any values as you see fit. Take note of the step to acquire a valid TikTok session ID value if you intend to use those voices, as these will not generate any audio without one. Lastly, ensure the `AUDIO_DIR` exists and is writable, especially if you have changed it from the default value. Composer will have attempted to create the default directory for you, and the script itself will always try to create your configured directory if it does not exist. But depending on how your PHP is set up this may not be possible.

## Usage notes
Many of the services used aren't intended for professional/commercial use or are utilising a live demo, and as such they have limitations. As a reminder: You should only be using this to test how your text sounds in various voices. If you need to use TTS for commercial purposes please check out the services' respective websites linked below for more information.

Regarding URL validity, it is recommended you enable local saving in `config.php` if you'll be requiring access to the audio again in the near future. The same advice goes for services that return the audio as a data URI, as this can be inconvenient for sharing when message length is a concern.

### TTS Services/APIs included (and their limitations)

#### [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) (via StreamElements or Streamlabs APIs)
- (StreamElements) 3000 byte text limit
- (StreamElements) Generated audio (MP3) is returned as a data URI
- (Streamlabs) 550 byte text limit
- (Streamlabs) TTS URLs are valid for only 5 minutes
#### [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) (via StreamElements API)
- 3000 byte text limit
#### [CereProc](https://cereproc.com/)
- 2000 byte text limit
#### [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/)
- 300 character text limit
- valid session ID cookie required (see `config.php` for details on how to get one)
- API is undocumented and not all voice IDs are known
- Generated audio (MP3) is returned as a data URI
#### [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/products/text-to-speech)
- Generated audio (MP3) is returned as a data URI
#### [Acapela](https://www.acapela-group.com/demos/)
- 2000 character text limit
#### [Oddcast](https://www.oddcast.com/ttsdemo/)
- 600 character text limit
#### [Cepstral](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos)
- No practical character limit appears to be in place, but it is set to 5000 because anything over this takes well over a minute to generate.
- Their server rate-limits requests. It is highly likely that Cepstral will often not work on the demo due to the traffic it receives. It is recommended you use their own site directly, otherwise you'll have to host this library yourself.
#### [Microsoft Azure Speech](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Speech-Service/) (via [Bing Translator](https://www.bing.com/translator))
- 3000 byte text limit
- Generated audio (MP3) is returned as a data URI
#### [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)
- 200 character limit
- Generated audio (MP3) is returned as a data URI
